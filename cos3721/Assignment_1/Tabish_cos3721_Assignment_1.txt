Q.1. 
Advantages:
-Deeper customizability
-Vast community support
These are advantages for programmers
Disadvantages:
-There are challenges in compatibility with a wide range of hardware devices
-High complexity for beginner/casual users.
These are disadvantages for casual end-users.

1.2.
-Mobile devices have very limited resources to accomodate its portable nature.To ensure a smooth operating system on mobile the operating system must be overly effecient.
-Unlike traditional PCs, mobile devices may very from each model and manufacturer which requires extra work to accomodate every device.

1.3.
Registers, cache, Ram, nonvolatile memory, hard-disk drives, optical disks, magnetic tapes.

Q.2
Message passing and Remote procedure calls.

2.2.
Message passing:
Strengths:
-Reliability
-Flexibility
-Platform independent
Weaknesses:
-Potential for deadlocks
-Complex implementation

RPC:
Strengths:
-Simple to implement
-Offers efficient communication
-Support for various programming languages
Weaknesses:
-Limited support for error handling
-Can introduce performance bottlenecks.

2.3. Java programs running on Android systems do not use the standard Java API and virtual machine (JVM) primarily due to historical reasons and differences in the underlying architecture and requirements of the Android platform.

Q.3 162 processes.

3.2. At line marked 'x' the output will be 'CHILD: 0 CHILD: -2 CHILD: -4 CHILD: -6 CHILD: -8' because each element is multiplied by '-1'.
At line marked 'y' the output will be 'PARENT: 0 PARENT: 2 PARENT: 4 PARENT: 6 PARENT: 8' because each element is multiplied by '1'.

3.3. Save state into PCB0, reload state from PCB1, perform an interrupt, save state into PCB1, reload state from PCB0.

Q.4.
a) 1.89/1.7142
b) 2.34899/1.504
c) 2.5/3.333

4.2.
a) 6 unique processes
b) 1 unique thread

4.3.
a) Task
b) Data parallelism
c) Task

Q.5.
5.1. b) 15, 35, 35, 50, 35, 40
5.1. c) 0, 15, 15, 30, 30, 25

5.2. a) The predicted CPU burst length may not accurately reflect changes in the workload patterns or system dynamics.
b) This would result in a prediction model that is highly responsive to short-term changes in the workload while still considering past observations.
